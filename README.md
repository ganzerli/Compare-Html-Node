An attempt to search throught the tags of an html page downloaded with java,
it was a  simple basic beginning to create something with the functionality of jsoup.
To download jsoup it was also a very good idea, so i decided to switch to that instead to split out the tags from an html string.
But , with my big surprise, yesterday 18/04/2019 , to renew my computer after a cyber attack , erasing all my system, I sadly discovered that to get java running on my computer it is not so easily suitable, at least for a single beginner developer and code enthusiast like me, for the new oracle restrictions.
